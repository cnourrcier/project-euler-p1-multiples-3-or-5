// Notes:

// 1. After checking divisibility by 2 and 3, you can skip checking multiples of these numbers.
// Any prime number greater than 3 can be written in the form of 6kÂ±1 (where k is an integer). 
// This is because numbers of the form 6k, 6k+2, 6k+3, 6k+4 are all divisible by 2 or 3.
// By incrementing i by 6, you efficiently check potential prime factors without checking every single number.

// 2. key property of factors: if a number n can be factored into two factors a and b (where n = a * b), 
// then at least one of those factors must be less than or equal to the square root of n.
// By checking up to the square root of n, you ensure that you find all possible factors without redundant checks.
// Any factor larger than sqrt(n) would have a corresponding factor smaller than sqrt(n).
